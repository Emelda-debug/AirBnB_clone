This project by Emelda and Maryann, will see us building our first full web application: the AirBnB clone.

The first step will be to write a command interpreter to manage our AirBnB objects.

The command intepreter is a program that allows the entering of commands and then executes those commands to the operating system

This is is very important because we will use it for other  projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integrationâ€¦

Our console is the command intepreter that will create a new objwct, operate on it, retreive and destroy the object.

The storage engine in the FileStorage class will handle all the classes.

The console will work like this in interacyive mode
./console.py

But also in non-interactive mode
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

This project will have  Python Unit Tests for our Python scripts.
